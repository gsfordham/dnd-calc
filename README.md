# dnd-calc
A Dungeons and Dragons Stat Calculator.

It's based off of the 5e.

The code could probably use to be improved, but it works. If I remember correctly, I was messing around with some of it, back then, and I just never did the optimizations. There's also a few parts that don't apply limits on bonuses, so just keep that in mind.

I haven't played it in a while, so I haven't bothered to update it, but I might do so in the future. I know some people who do play, right now, however, so I figured I'd upload it.

To install:
1) Download everything in the D&D folder.
2) Save it wherever you want.
3) Open the HTML file with a Web browser.
4) Make sure JavaScript is enabled, or it won't work.

Hope you find it useful in your gaming!
